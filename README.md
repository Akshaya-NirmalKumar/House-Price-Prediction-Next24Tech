🏡 House Price Prediction – Internship Task 1 (Next24Tech)
Project by: Akshaya N 

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a House Price Prediction System using advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms.
The model learns from historical housing data and predicts future prices based on features like area, bedrooms, location, and more.

🧠 Problem Statement
Develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts house prices based on various features from the dataset such as living area, number of bathrooms, location details, etc.

🧰 Tech Stack
📊 Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
🧹 Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Linear & Random Forest Regressor)
💾 Pickle – Model serialization
