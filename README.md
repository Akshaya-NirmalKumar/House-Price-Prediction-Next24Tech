 🧠 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Removed features with excessive nulls

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized price trends and correlations
   - Checked distributions and categorical impacts

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Label encoding for categorical columns
   - Normalization and transformation of features

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

5. **Final Result**
   - Achieved RMSE: **~39,652**
   - Successfully predicted house prices with decent accuracy
